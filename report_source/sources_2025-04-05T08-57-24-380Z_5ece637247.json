    "domain": "wired.jp",
    "reliabilityScore": 0.85,
    "reliabilityReasoning": "Wired.jp, as the Japanese arm of the well-established Wired brand, is known for its rigorous editorial standards, fact-checking, and reliance on industry experts. Although it is a professional news source rather than a peer-reviewed academic publication, its transparent methodology and consistent track record in covering technology make it very reliable for research on quantum computing trends and challenges."

    "domain": "www.idtechex.com",
    "reliabilityScore": 0.75,
    "reliabilityReasoning": "www.idtechex.com is a professional industry news platform that generally adheres to established editorial standards and fact-checking processes, and it is recognized for providing timely and relevant information on technological developments like quantum computing. However, its content is primarily aimed at an industry audience rather than an academic one, and while it is reliable for current trends, it lacks the peer-review level rigor of academic journals, which slightly moderates its reliability score."

    "domain": "hioka.sj",
    "reliabilityScore": 0.45,
    "reliabilityReasoning": "The hioka.sj domain appears to be a less established source with unclear editorial oversight, fact-checking procedures, and transparency regarding methodologies and sourcing. Although it may focus on quantum computing topics, its reputation, professional credentials, and track record in the field are not well recognized, thereby limiting its reliability as a primary research source."

    "domain": "www.nextech-week.jp",
    "reliabilityScore": 0.75,
    "reliabilityReasoning": "The domain appears to be run by a professional media outlet with a specific focus on emerging technologies, which suggests reasonable editorial oversight and subject matter expertise, though it does not match the rigorous standards (such as peer review or detailed academic methodologies) expected of primary academic sources. Additionally, potential commercial interests and a focus on news-style reporting could introduce biases in coverage of nuanced topics like quantum computing."

    "reliabilityScore": 0.85,
    "reliabilityReasoning": "www.jri.co.jp is a professional, corporate research institute website with strong editorial standards and domain expertise, as evidenced by its detailed, expert-driven content and consistent track record; however, some potential commercial biases inherent to corporate research may slightly temper its overall objectivity."
