# Open Deep Research MCP Server

An AI-powered research assistant that performs deep, iterative research on any topic. It combines search engines, web scraping, and AI to explore topics in depth and generate comprehensive reports. Available as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool or standalone CLI. Look at exampleout.md to see what a report might look like.

## Quick Start

1. Clone and install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ozamatash/deep-research
cd deep-research
npm install
```

2. Set up environment in `.env.local`:
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env.local
```

3. Build:
```bash
# Build the server
npm run build
```

4. Run the cli version:
```bash
npm run start "Your research query here"
```
5. Test MCP Server with Claude Desktop:

## Features

- Performs deep, iterative research by generating targeted search queries
- Controls research scope with depth (how deep, max 3) and breadth (how wide, max 3) parameters
- Evaluates source reliability with detailed scoring (0-1) and reasoning
- Prioritizes high-reliability sources (â‰¥0.7) and verifies less reliable information
- Generates follow-up questions to better understand research needs
- Produces detailed markdown reports with findings, sources, and reliability assessments
- **Resource Efficiency:** Automatically starts and stops local Firecrawl Docker containers on demand (using `docker-compose up` and `docker-compose down -v`), saving system resources when the tool is not actively running. Includes health checks to minimize wait times after startup.

- Available as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool for AI agents
- For now MCP version doesn't ask follow up questions

## Execution Time Notes

- **Local Firecrawl:** When using the local Firecrawl setup (especially with the searXNG backend), the execution time can vary significantly based on system resources and the complexity of the research.
- **Example (Local Firecrawl, depth=3, breadth=3):** On a typical development machine, a research task with `depth=3` and `breadth=3` might take around **5-6 minutes** to complete. This includes Docker startup (with health checks), multiple levels of web searches, content processing, AI analysis, and report generation.
- **API Usage:** Using the Firecrawl API directly (requires an API key) might offer different performance characteristics.
- **Parameter Impact:** Increasing `depth` or `breadth` will exponentially increase the number of tasks and thus the execution time. While the maximum allowed values are `depth=5` and `breadth=5`, using values **above 3** for either parameter significantly increases the risk of exceeding a 10-minute timeout, especially when using local Firecrawl. It is recommended to start with lower values (e.g., 2 or 3) and increase cautiously based on observed performance.

## Advanced Setup

### Using Local Firecrawl (Free Option)

Instead of using the Firecrawl API, you can run a local instance. You can use the official repo or my fork which uses searXNG as the search backend to avoid using a searchapi key:

1. Set up local Firecrawl:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ozamatash/localfirecrawl
cd localfirecrawl
# Follow setup in localfirecrawl README
```

2. Update `.env.local`:
```bash
FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3002"
```

### Optional: Observability

Add observability to track research flows, queries, and results using Langfuse:

```bash
# Add to .env.local
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="your_langfuse_public_key"
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="your_langfuse_secret_key"
```

The app works normally without observability if no Langfuse keys are provided.
